**Business Problem:**  
To ensure there is no discrimination between employees, it is imperative for the Human Resources 
department of Delta Ltd. to maintain a salary range for each employee with similar profiles
Apart from the existing salary, there is a considerable number of factors regarding an employeeâ€™s 
experience and other abilities to which they get evaluated in interviews. Given the data related to 
individuals who applied in Delta Ltd, models can be built that can automatically determine salary 
which should be offered if the prospective candidate is selected in the company. This model seeks to 
minimize human judgment with regard to salary to be offered.  
**Goal & Objective:**  
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will 
determine an employee's salary to be offered, such that manual judgments on selection are 
minimized. It is intended to have a robust approach and eliminate any discrimination in salary 
among similar employee profile.
